covid19_care_capacity_map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hospital bed capacity by state vs covid19 cases  
May help present problem to those shrugging the COVID19 problem off?  \
For now plan to display hospital bed and hospitalized patient count \
Ideally also get ICU bed count and usage.

DEV NOTES
=========


* https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/state-data-and-policy-actions-to-address-coronavirus/#stateleveldata
    - ploy this against a map of population data, per state.
    - kff on same page has covid19 cases and deaths, but no date on the dataâ€¦

	
* There are likely newer data, but here is a rough guide of population by state: \
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States_by_population
		
		
* https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/choropleth-studio-gl-pt-1/
    - previous published mapbox studio used "stateData-6oppga as data source, named as sn50.a1rkty36

geoJSON format
==============

Snippet of state polygon from stateData.geojson:

.. code:: geojson

    //{ "type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [ {
            "type":         "Feature",
            "id":           "01",
            "properties": {
                            "name":"Alabama",
                            "density":94.65},
	    "geometry":   { "type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-87.359296,35.00118],[-85.606675,34.984749],
	... ]]}},
    //]}

.. github rst dont know geojson5, likely just parsed as vanilla text block.

Prototype 1: for what mapbox would need.  This one is a single date entry (ie, would use diff file for data of another date, may create too many files).   mapbox import ok, data format parsed as expected
``json5 EgPropertySingle.json5 > singlePropertyEg.geojson``

Prototype 2 alternate format for mapbox.  This one is use nesting, containing 2 date entres (ie, would use single datafile and upload to mapbox).
see ``json5 EgPropertyArray.json5 > EgPropertyArray.geojson`` 
would mapbox take it?  can it be queried in web app? and colored correctly?  TBD
No, while could create correct .json, mapbox complained during import: ``Input failed. "properties" member should be object, but is an Array instead on line 1.``

Thus, essentially, each Feature need to have its geometry.
Multiple date entry for same state would need multiple feature, each with its own geometry (coordinate list).
Then, may as well just have one file per date.

Correctly imported by mapbox (tin117): 
- EgPropertySingle_x2.json5
- EgPropertySingle_x3.json5

Pros and cons of single .geojson vs many files, one per date:

- single file will end up more compressible, faster to load, less javascript coding?   Untested approach.
- multiple file will be tried method as done for previous data viz proj with mapbox.
- maybe mood point now, dont actually need to upload to mapbox and generate tileset (though that may actually be faster?)

Algorithm
=========

* .geojson can be stored on fs, instead of a tileset in mapbox server
* single .geojson file, color like NYC collision eg
* HI likely a multi polygon, so create a state.ndjson
* csv-etl.py script to create csv with data i need, include the calculated columns
* ndjson join :  csv(case) + kpp(bed count) --> ndjson 
* ndjson join :  ndjson + state --> geojson
* see details of csv2json, join, map at https://github.com/mbostock/ndjson-cli

Detail steps 
------------ 

::

# there are comments at top and bottom of the csv from kff, may need to clean them first 
cat kff_capacity_dw_2020_0409.csv  | fgrep '",' | csv2json -n > kff_capacity_dw_2020_0409.ndjson # Alaska, Alabama  # 69 entries

cat stateData.geojson | json5 | ndjson-split 'd.features' > stateData.ndjson # 52 "states": Alabama, Hawaii, Puerto Rico  # **no mapping yet**

cat stateData.ndjson | ndjson-map 'd.Location = d.properties.name, d' > stateData-loc.ndjson #  **add mapping, create key field for join**

ndjson-join        'd.Location'                    kff_capacity_dw_2020_0409.ndjson stateData-loc.ndjson > capacity+state.ndjson    # 51 entries now, decent **join**

# result of 1 entry below, split into multiple lines by me.  Note it has two elements, as d[0] and d[1] # ??

Dev Env
=======

To avoid CORS error (since html need to load a .geojson), run a simple web server from the directory containing the files of the project ::

        python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

Then on browser, navigate to http://localhost:8000
