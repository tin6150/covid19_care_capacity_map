covid19_care_capacity_map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hospital bed capacity by state vs covid19 cases  
May help present problem to those shrugging the COVID19 problem off?  \
For now plan to display hospital bed and hospitalized patient count \
Ideally also get ICU bed count and usage.


.. .md two tailing white spaces cannot cause a hard line break  
.. nor can \ 
.. i wondered about: \ at the end, but that didnt work either


DEV NOTES
=========


* https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/state-data-and-policy-actions-to-address-coronavirus/#stateleveldata
    - ploy this against a map of population data, per state.
    - kff on same page has covid19 cases and deaths, but no date on the dataâ€¦

	
* There are likely newer data, but here is a rough guide of population by state: \
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States_by_population
		
		
* https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/choropleth-studio-gl-pt-1/
    - previous published mapbox studio used "stateData-6oppga as data source, named as sn50.a1rkty36 
    - state data: https://docs.mapbox.com/help/demos/choropleth-studio-gl/stateData.geojson

Tools

observableHQ.com
    jupeter notebook on steroid? tuned for interactive data exploration and viz

ndjson-cli
    newline delimited json.  leverage/combine features of unix shell and javascript.   \
    A 4 part tutorial with many commands to manipulate gis data:
    https://medium.com/@mbostock/command-line-cartography-part-2-c3a82c5c0f3

merge csv with state/date/case data vs geojson/js coordinate file, joining it via id such as state name (?) 
    ndjson-join 'd.id' ca-albers-id.ndjson  cb_2014_06_tract_B01003.ndjson > ca-albers-join.ndjson
		
TopoJSON 
    use ARCs instead of sequence of coordinates, thus reducing file size. \
    topomerge can combine census track data into county level data.

	join with state*gson to create gson for Mapbox ?



geoJSON format
==============

Snippet of state polygon from stateData.geojson:

.. code:: geojson

    //{ "type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [ {
            "type":         "Feature",
            "id":           "01",
            "properties": {
                            "name":"Alabama",
                            "density":94.65},
	    "geometry":   { "type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-87.359296,35.00118],[-85.606675,34.984749],
	... ]]}},
    //]}

.. github rst dont know geojson5, likely just parsed as vanilla text block.
.. code:: geojson5

        {"type":"Feature","id":"01","properties":{"name":"Alabama","density":94.65},
            "geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-87.359296,35.00118],[-85.606675,34.984749],
        ... ]]}},

.. code:: geojson

	{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[
		{"type":"Feature","id":"72","properties":{"name":"Puerto Rico","density":1082 },"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-66.448338,17.984326],[-66.771478,18.006234],[-66.924832,17.929556],[-66.985078,17.973372],[-67.209633,17.956941],[-67.154863,18.19245],[-67.269879,18.362235],[-67.094617,18.515589],[-66.957694,18.488204],[-66.409999,18.488204],[-65.840398,18.433435],[-65.632274,18.367712],[-65.626797,18.203403],[-65.730859,18.186973],[-65.834921,18.017187],[-66.234737,17.929556],[-66.448338,17.984326]

what mapbox would need, single date entry (ie, use diff file for data of another date, may create too many files). 
Saving these as example files 
 - singlePropertyEg.json5 - a geojson file, but have comments.  use json5 to convert as needed.
 - nestedPropertyEg.geojson - properties has a list, one item per date, would mapbox take it?  can it be queried in web app? and colored correctly?  TBD

.. code:: json5
