Hospital bed capacity by state vs covid19 cases

May help present problem to those shrugging the COVID19 problem off?




DEV NOTES
=========


* https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/state-data-and-policy-actions-to-address-coronavirus/#stateleveldata
    - ploy this against a map of population data, per state.
    - kff on same page has covid19 cases and deaths, but no date on the dataâ€¦

	
* There are likely newer data, but here is a rough guide of population by state: \
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States_by_population
		
		
* https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/choropleth-studio-gl-pt-1/
    - previous published mapbox studio used "stateData-6oppga as data source, named as sn50.a1rkty36 
    - state data: https://docs.mapbox.com/help/demos/choropleth-studio-gl/stateData.geojson




OLD Dev Notes

  - choropleth tutorial from mapbox with state population data.

* https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/
   - leafletjs tutorial with actual geojson of state coordinate + population data from wikipedia and census. 
   - js snippet containing geo-coordinated data: https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/us-states.js

observableHQ.com
    jupeter notebook on steroid? tuned for interactive data exploration and viz

ndjson-cli
    newline delimited json.  leverage/combine features of unix shell and javascript.   \
    A 4 part tutorial with many commands to manipulate gis data:
    https://medium.com/@mbostock/command-line-cartography-part-2-c3a82c5c0f3

merge csv with state/date/case data vs geojson/js coordinate file, joining it via id such as state name (?) 
    ndjson-join 'd.id' ca-albers-id.ndjson  cb_2014_06_tract_B01003.ndjson > ca-albers-join.ndjson
		
TopoJSON 
    use ARCs instead of sequence of coordinates, thus reducing file size. \
    topomerge can combine census track data into county level data.
